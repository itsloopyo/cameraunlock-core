:: <Game Name> Head Tracking - Install
:: ============================================
:: Thin wrapper - install body lives in cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-shim.cmd,
:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.
::
:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:
:: cameraunlock-core/scripts/templates/install-wrapper-shim.cmd. Copy this
:: file to <mod>/scripts/install.cmd, fill in the CONFIG BLOCK, change nothing
:: else. scripts/conformance.ps1 checks that nothing else changed.
::
:: Shim-only: the mod DLL is itself a system-DLL proxy the game loads
:: directly, so there is no framework to install. Any pre-existing DLL of that
:: name is preserved as <name>.backup on first install for uninstall to
:: restore, which is why FRAMEWORK_TYPE is None.
