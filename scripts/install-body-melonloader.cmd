:: CameraUnlock MelonLoader install body (shared)
:: ============================================
:: Source of truth: cameraunlock-core/scripts/install-body-melonloader.cmd.
:: Per-mod install.cmd wrappers set the CONFIG BLOCK + WRAPPER_DIR and
:: `call` here.
::
:: MelonLoader layout: mod DLL in <game>/Mods/, UserLibs in <game>/UserLibs/.
:: Loader files: version.dll, dobby.dll, MelonLoader/ at game root.
::
:: Required env from the wrapper:
::   WRAPPER_DIR              wrapper's %~dp0
::   GAME_ID, MOD_DISPLAY_NAME, MOD_DLLS, MOD_INTERNAL_NAME, MOD_VERSION
::   STATE_FILE, FRAMEWORK_TYPE (always "MelonLoader")
::   MELONLOADER_MARKER       relative path tested for presence (default
::                            MelonLoader\net35\MelonLoader.dll; net6 for
::                            IL2CPP / modern Mono games)
::   MOD_CONTROLS             optional post-install help text
::
:: Launcher CLI (passed through %*): [GAME_PATH] [/y] [/force]
::   /force is accepted and ignored - it only means something to uninstall.
:: ============================================

:: :detect_yes_flag and the arg parser below both break if the wrapper left
:: delayed expansion on (see :parse_args), so pin it off for the whole body.
